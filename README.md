# journal-bib-styles
This repo contains `.bst` and `.dbj` files to style BibTeX-based bibliographies according to the specifications of journals that accept TeX submissions but don't currently provide official `.bst` files. Feel free to use these when preparing submissions. 

The `.bst` files provided here should work out of the box, but they can be modified or improved by editing the corresponding `.dbj` files. Pull requests that fix errors or add functionality for new reference types are welcome!
